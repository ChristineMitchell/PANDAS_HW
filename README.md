# PyCity Schools Analysis

## Overview and Purpose of the Project
We were asked to complete an analysis on the PyCity School District test results utilizing Jupyter Notebook and the Pandas Library. With these tools, we were able to import and read the csv files of raw reporting data; then we were able to inspect, clean, and perform calculations with the data; and lastly, we created dataframe tables to complete our analysis of the school district results. We not only wanted to look at how the data rolled up at the district level, but we also wanted to see how the different schools faired amongst each other. The measurements evaluated were the following: 

      •	average math scores,

      •	average reading scores,

      •	the percentage of students who passed their math tests by 70% or more,

      •	the percentage of students who passed their reading test by 70% or more, as well as the

      •	the overall percentage of students who passed both their math and reading tests by 70% or more.


We utilized the last measurement, overall percentage of students who passed both their math and reading tests by 70% or more, to determine the top five schools in the district, as well as the bottom five schools. 

The stakeholders were eager to see the breakdown of the average math scores and the average reading scores by grade level for each high school in the district.

They wanted to look at the data from other angles as well. Because they wanted to see if the amount that a school spends per student impacts the results, we grouped the schools by spending levels to then evaluate the five measurements above. As well, we evaluated if the school size had any impact to the measurements above. Lastly, we wanted to compare the charter school results with the district school results. All of this will help the school board set their budgets for the upcoming school year.

Unfortunately, upon completing our data slicing and dicing, we learned that there was concern about the integrity of the freshman class results at one of the charter schools, Thomas High School, due to academic dishonesty. Therefore, we were tasked to “clean” the data by removing the math and reading results for the 9th graders at Thomas High School, re-run the analysis, and determine if the changes made impacted the overall analysis.
